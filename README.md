# Playble PopupStore
Using blockchain technology's NFTs, this online pop-up store allows users to exhibit and trade on an open map.

## 1. Introduction
Offline pop-up stores have many inconveniences.   
For example, pop-up stores for popular games like 'Genshin' attract large crowds.   
If these stores operate offline, crowd management becomes a problem. Additionally, many 'goods' sold at pop-up stores are often counterfeit.

This project aims to solve these issues by creating an online pop-up store.   
To prevent the counterfeiting of goods sold at the online pop-up store, blockchain NFT technology is utilized.
